This is a test post designed to verify the functionality and appearance of the new audio player.

## Audio Player Test 1: Basic Embed with Title

This test embeds an MP3 audio file with a title.

## Audio Player Test 2: Embed Without Title

## Audio Player Test 3: Another Example

A third audio player to check for consistent styling and behavior.

Please verify the following when viewing this post on the website:
1. All three audio players are rendered correctly.
2. The styling matches the intended Fuwari/Astro aesthetic.
3. Audio playback (play, pause, seek, volume) functions as expected.
4. The players are responsive across different screen sizes.
5. The title "SoundHelix Song 1" and "SoundHelix Song 3" are somehow associated with the first and third players respectively (e.g., as a tooltip on the player div).
